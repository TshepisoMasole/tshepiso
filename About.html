        <h1>ABOUT LONDON</h1>
        <p>London, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is a 21st-century city with history 
         stretching back to Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, 
         the iconic ‘Big Ben’ clock tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British monarch coronations.
         Across the Thames River, the London Eye observation wheel provides panoramic views of the
         South Bank cultural complex, and the entire city.</p>
         
    </section>
    <section class="history">
        <h1>HISTORY OF LONDON</h1>
        <p>London is situated on the banks of the River Thames. It is the seat of the Government of the 
            United Kingdom and the country’s financial centre. The city has used its privileged location
             in southeastern England to its advantage, having always been a densely populated and wealthy area.</p>

        <h2>London's foundation</h2>
        <p>The city of London was founded by the Romans and their rule extended from 43 AD to the fifth century AD,
             when the Empire fell. During the third century, Londinium, the name given to the town by the Romans, 
             had a population of 50,000, mainly due to the influence of its major port.</p>
            
        <p>As a consequence of repeated Anglo-Saxon invasions during the fifth century, Londinium declined and during 
            the eighth century it became the capital of the Kingdom of Essex.</p>
            
        <p>During the ninth century, the town suffered numerous Viking attacks. As a consequence, Danish settlers
            established themselves in the area, encouraging trade and opening businesses in the town, transforming
            it into the first urban centre of England. The town’s wealth and power attracted the Danish Great Heathen
           Army, which besieged the city until it was captured by King Alfred the Great in 886.</p> 
            
        <p>In 1067, following the Norman invasion and conquering of England, the city's existing rights, laws and
             privileges were established by the newly crowned King of England, William Duke of Normandy. The Tower
              of London was built during William's reign.</p>
            
         <p>In 1199, King John reinforced the city's self-government, and in 1215 the city could elect a different 
             mayor every year.
            
        <p>For many years, England had no capital city. However, the institutions of central government were moved
             to Westminster, close to London. This and the rise of trade in the area were two decisive factors in 
             London's emergence as the capital of England.</p> 
            
        <h2>An ever-growing city</h2>
        <p> During the fourteenth century, London’s port became a European hub for the distribution of goods. This
             activity was strengthened during the fifteenth century thanks to its relevant textile industry.</p>
            
        <p>From the sixteenth to mid-seventeenth century, London benefited from the centralized politics and the 
            maritime trade expansion developed by the Tudors and continued by the Stuarts. During Henry VIII’s reign
             London had 100,000 inhabitants. In mid-seventeenth century it had over 500,000.</p>
            
        <p>In 1665, the city was still held inside the ancient walls although large-scale urban planning had already 
            started. The population’s poor living conditions were responsible for the Great Plague, killing 70,000 people, 
            and the following year, a huge fire burnt down most of the city. The reconstruction of London, based on the 
            area we now call "The City", took over 10 years to finish. The architect Christopher Wren’s masterpieces such
             as St. Paul’s Cathedral increased the appeal of London, and thus the capital became the centre of English 
             social life with palaces, halls, theatres, societies (Royal Society, 1662) and museums (British Museum, 1753).</p>
            
        <p>London continued to grow thanks to the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694. It was the second central 
            bank in the world, rapidly following the Swedish Sveriges Riksbank, and arguably the most successful: it
             provided the financial flexibility which would be the foundation of the empire's power and whose vestiges
              can be seen today in London's preeminence as a financial centre.
            
        <p>Most of current London is from the Victorian period. Up until the early years of the nineteenth century,
            the capital was confined to the boundaries of the original Roman city, as well as Westminster and Mayfair,
            and was surrounded by fields. Be that as it may, the Industrial Revolution drew millions of people to London,
            expanding the city. However, the overcrowded conditions led to grave problems like the 1832 cholera epidemics,
            or the great stink of 1858, an event that took place during the hottest months of the summer, exacerbating 
            the smell of the sewers that were dumped in the River Thames, which led to the suspension of the parliamentary 
            sessions.</p>
            
        <p>From 1750, the population increased from 700,000 to over 4,500,000 in 1901 (6,600,000 if we include the suburban areas).
             At the end of the nineteenth century, London had become a major international trade and finance capital.</p>
            
        <p>The administrative needs of a city with so much commercial activity led the creation of a new autonomous 
            territorial unit in 1888, the County of London, ruled by the "London county council". This county was
             divided into twenty-nine electoral units (the city and 28 metropolitan boroughs), but the progressive 
             expansion soon overflowed outside the county boundaries to the suburban areas. After a steady period,
              the population of the capital began to decline at the end of World War I and fell below 3.5 million by 1950.
               In contrast, the suburban area grew steadily.</p>
            
        <p>In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are 
            the divisions which can be seen today.</p>

            FACTS ABOUT LONDON
        </h1>
        <img src="images/london-night-skyline-1170x508.jpg">
       <h2> 1) London is the smallest city in England</h2>
           <p>That’s right. The megacity that most of us know as London is actually called ‘Greater London’, 
           whilst the City of London itself is a small portion of this sprawling metropolis. 
           It has a population of only 9,123 people, making it the smallest in England.</p>

       <h2>2)…and it’s technically a forest</h2>
          <p>We’ve spoken before about how green the capital is. It’s hard to grasp unless you’ve visited, but 
          the amount of greenery and green space you can enjoy in London is enormous. So much so, in fact, 
          that the density of trees it has per square mile qualifies it as a forest as per the United Nations definition.</p>

       <h2>3) Over half of the London Underground runs above ground</h2>
        <p>So really it should be called the Overground. Except we already have an 
            Overground. Ah well, I think I’ll stick to calling it ‘the tube’.</p>
        <img src="images/london-underground.jpg">

        <h2>4 ) ‘Big Ben’ isn’t actually called Big Ben</h2>
            <p>Tourists from all over the world come to stand on Westminster Bridge and take a 
            selfie next to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Unfortunately, not one of them ever leaves with a picture of it. This world-famous 
            landmark is actually named the Elizabeth Tower – Big Ben is the name of the bell that lives inside. So you won’t snap a photo of Big Ben 
            but if you’re lucky you might get to hear it.</p>

       <h2>5) Rainy London isn’t very rainy</h2>
        <p>The capital is known worldwide for being a rainy city. Except for the fact, that it’s not true at all. 
        London actually sees less rain than Rome, Miami, and Sydney both in terms of volume and number of rainy days.</p>

        <img src="images/london-rainy-day-1024x683.jpg">
        <h2>6) Most Londoners don’t live in London</h2>
        <p>Walk the streets of London and most of the people around you probably won’t be ‘true’ Londoners. The resident
             population of the city of Greater London is just over 8.5 million people. However, the city gets over 16 
             million visitors every year – a staggering number!</p>

         <h2>7) It has more Indian restaurants than Mumbai</h2>
         <p>Even though technically every restaurant in Mumbai is an Indian restaurant, London has so many excellent
              eateries that it far outweighs its culinary rival. If you want a great curry, you’re better off going to London over India.</p>

          <h2>8) Traffic hasn’t improved in one-hundred years</h2>
          <p>If, that is, you’re going by speed of movement across the city. Vehicles driving through the city centre average a
               top speed of 7.4 miles an hour – about the same speed as a horse and cab. Next time you head out on a trip to the
                London Eye, we suggest you walk it.</p>


        <img src="images/london-bridge-traffic-1024x876.jpg">
        <h2>9) You can drive on the right side of the road, which is the wrong side of the road</h2>
         <p>Everybody knows that English people drive on the left-hand side of the road. However, there is one street in the UK 
             where visitors can get back to their roots. Savoy Court is a road just off the Strand on which drivers are required by 
             law to drive on the right-hand side of the road.</p>

       <h2>10) Wait, which city are we talking about?</h2>
       <p>The capital of the UK isn’t the only city in the world called London. The U.S. has ten, Canada one,
        France one – there is even an asteroid called London. Make sure you know where you’re going next time you book tickets!</p>
